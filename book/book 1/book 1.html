        Just at that moment the sun was streaming through the ivy-covered archway and the door was open and the world outside was so joyous that Mary skipped and Dickon skipped and Colin laughed outright. ‘I shall get well! I shall get well!’ he cried out. ‘Mary! Dickon! I shall get well! And I shall live forever and ever and ever!’ The sun was pouring golden light and warmth over everything and there were crimson and blue flowers lifting their heads, and the grass and trees were green and birds were singing and butterflies were flying and everything was alive with the hope and joy of morning. Mary and Dickon stood and laughed too and then they sat down with Colin and watched the world waking up and coming alive in the secret garden.       </p>
